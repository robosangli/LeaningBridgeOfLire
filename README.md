# LeaningBridgeOfLire
This repository is for the 'Leaning Bridge of Lire' UR3 Robot Code written by Ananda Sangli & Kai Liang in May 2023. This implementation won 3rd place in a competition held by the ECE Department at UIUC for building a 9 layer bridge with a length of 28.3 cm.
The code utilizes scripts implementing blob detection of the bridge blocks, block angle calculation w.r.t. a reference axis, rotation & alignment algorithm, block overhang calcuation for the bridge, and several optimization techniques upon testing.
